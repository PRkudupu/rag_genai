The data file contains eight \nseparate records. \nBy default, the data file will produce a PDF file containing eight separate pages. The selective \nuse of the bookmark file will produce the same PDF with a separate pane containing \nbookmarks. This screenshot of the sample output shows a PDF file with bookmarks. \n \nThe left pane displays the available bookmarks for this PDF. You may need to enable the \ndisplay of bookmarks in Adobe \uf8e8 Acrobat \uf8e8 Reader by clicking Window > Show Bookmarks . \nSelecting a date from the left pane displays the corresponding page within the document. \nNote that the index has been sorted according to the specification in the bookmark file, and that \npages within the file are created according to the original order in the data file. \n  \n \nPDF Bookmark Sample Page 2 of 4 \n Sample Data File \n^reformat trunc\n^symbolset WINLATIN1\n^field trans_date2000-01-1\n^field description\nDescription for item #1\n^field trans_type\nTYPE1^field trans_amount\n11.00\n^page 1\n^field trans_date\n2000-01-2^field description\nDescription for item #2\n^field trans_type\nTYPE2\n^field trans_amount11.00\n^page 1\n^field trans_date\n2000-01-3\n^field descriptionDescription for item #3\n^field trans_type\nTYPE3 \nSample Bookmark File \n[invoices]\nInvoices by Date=0\ntrans_date=1,A[type]\nInvoices by Item Type=0\ntrans_type=1,A\n[amount]\nInvoices by Transaction Amount=0trans_amount=1,D\nThe example bookmark file includes three distinct sections: \n\u2022 Invoices sorted, ascending, by date. \n\u2022 Invoices sorted, ascending, by item type. \n\u2022 Invoices sorted, descending, by transaction amount. \n  \n \nPDF Bookmark Sample Page 3 of 4 \n Sample Files \nThis sample package contains: \n \nFilename Description \nap_bookmark.IFD The template design. \nap_bookmark.mdf The template targeted for PDF output. \nap_bookmark.dat A sample data file in DAT format. \nap_bookmark.bmk A sample bookmark file. \nap_bookmark.pdf Sample PDF output. \nap_bookmark_doc.pdf A document describing the sample. \nDeploying the Sample \nTo deploy this sample in your environment: \n1.
